To see the results of my test runs, open tests.txt.

To run these yourself, just run these scripts from the command line, don't bother with starting 
the CLISP REPL.

Question #1

$ clisp interleave.clisp

Question #2

$ clisp cd.clisp

An interactive shell will start and demand that you provide a verb.  Then it will 
demand fillers.  After building 1 CD it will show you the result and ask if you want
to go again.
